# Cardputer App Boilerplate for M5Stack Cardputer

**This is a barebones app for the M5Stack Cardputer, which I designed to be a very basic, simple boilerplate to start building a custom app.**

This is the first app I've ever built as a tool to help me learn C++, but hopefully, this will help someone get started with understanding how the graphics, text input, and very basic menu selection can work.

**FEATURES:**

+ *Barebones* includes and variables to make a cardputer app run
+ **.ino** file to use Arduino IDE
+ Commented code to help slice functionality out of the app
+ **Splash Screen Demo**
+ **Basic Menu with Functionality**
+ **Basic Text Input Window** using the M5Stack text input example:
